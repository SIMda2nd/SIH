# 3D Space Planetarium

3D planetarium software is used to get information (position, rotation, velocity etc) about any planet/star in the galaxy. The user can explore the galaxy using a spaceship controlled by WASD/arrow keys.

This repository can be put in an empty Unity project or cloned into a child folder of an existing project.

Approach any star to know about its information!

The software was developed by the Team Crew_X for Smart Indian Hackathon 2022.
